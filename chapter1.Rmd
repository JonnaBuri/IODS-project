# Hello World!
### First R markdown attempt

# My thoughts about the course
*I'm very eager to see how this course turns out, mostly because*:

* I'm a doctoral student, specializing on theoretical Machine Learning
* but I usually work with python - not so fluent in R
* and this is a great opportunity to focus on **open** science
* just testing the list items now
 
*My github repository link can be found [here](https://github.com/JonnaBuri/IODS-project/)*
